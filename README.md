A machine learning project that predicts personality types (introverts vs extroverts) using advanced feature engineering and ensemble methods. This project achieved **Top 30%** ranking on the public leaderboard in the Kaggle competition.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of predicting personality types based on behavioral and psychological data. Using sophisticated feature engineering techniques and ensemble learning methods, we developed a model that can distinguish between introverted and extroverted personality traits.

### Competition Results
- **Public Leaderboard Rank**: 665/2293 (Top 30%)
- **Private Leaderboard**: Performance dropped due to model selection strategy
- **Platform**: Kaggle Competition
- **Category**: Classification Challenge

**Note**: While the public leaderboard showed strong performance (Top 30%), the private leaderboard performance was significantly lower. This occurred because Kaggle automatically selected the best model from the public dataset submissions, but my alternative model (which performed better on cross-validation) was not selected for the final evaluation. This highlights the importance of proper model selection strategy in Kaggle competitions.

## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Interaction terms, scaling methods, and feature selection
- **Ensemble Methods**: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
- **Cross-validation**: Robust model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- **Comprehensive EDA**: Detailed exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- **Reproducible Workflow**: End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- **Model Comparison**: Multiple algorithms tested and compared
